# MPMB-UA23PT7-Content
# THIS IS A WIP SCRIPT AT THE MOMENT.
Adds the content from "Unearthed Arcana 2023: Player's Handbook Playtest 7" to the MPMB Character Sheets.

**Script Credit Note:**
A lot of the content of this script is either ripped directly from existing code or is an altered form of existing code. I have tried to diligently note when I copied code from elsewhere, but I probably missed some instances. A lack of note saying I ripped the code from elsewhere either means that I wrote that section of code entirely myself or that the code that was copied to use as a starting point was so heavily altered by me that almost nothing of the copied code exists.
