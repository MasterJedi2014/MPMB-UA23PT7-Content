# MPMB-UA23PT7-Content
# THIS IS A WIP SCRIPT AT THE MOMENT.
Adds the content from "Unearthed Arcana 2023: Player's Handbook Playtest 7" to the MPMB Character Sheets.

**Script Credit Note:**
A lot of the content of this script is either ripped directly from existing code or is an altered form of existing code. I have tried to diligently note when I copied code from elsewhere, but I probably missed some instances. A lack of note saying I ripped the code from elsewhere either means that I wrote that section of code entirely myself or that the code that was copied to use as a starting point was so heavily altered by me that almost nothing of the copied code exists.

**Detailed List of Script Content:**
- UA23PT7 Fighter & its subclasses
  - Battle Master
  - Brawler
  - Champion
  - Eldritch Knight
- UA23PT7 Sorcerer & its subclasses
  - Draconic
  - Wild Magic

This encompasses all of the content in this UA article that wasn't superseded or removed in later content.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.

**Script Patch Notes:**
- **2024-05-07:**
  - Initial upload of WIP V2.2 & V3 of the script.
- **2024-05-08:**
  - Replacement of WIP V2.2 with V2.9, & update to V3 of the script. Scripts now have all UA Warlock content, though not all of that content works correctly at the moment. 

**Known Bugs:**
- WIP file, so there will be a lot of bugs and mistakes until the file is complete. Will update when the script is finished.
- Pact of the Blade does not add a weapon's Mastery property like it should be doing.
- A not insignificant number of the Eldritch Invocations are failing to appear in the "Choose Feature" menu.
